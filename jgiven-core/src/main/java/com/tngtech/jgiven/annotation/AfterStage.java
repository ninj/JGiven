/**
 * Marks methods to be executed after a stage has been executed.
 * This essentially means that the method is executed
 * either on next call of a step method of the next stage,
 * or, for the last stage, after the scenario (but before any {@link AfterScenario} method).
 * <p>
 * If marked as repeatable, the {@code @AfterStage} method will execute every time a stage is reused,
 * if not marked as repeatable,it is guaranteed that {@code @AfterStage} methods are only invoked once.
 * <p>
 * {@code @AfterStage} can be used to finish builders, for example.
